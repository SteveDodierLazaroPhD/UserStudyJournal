Release Tasks
------------------------------------------

1. Bump the VERSION number in src/config.py.

2. Update the NEWS file, and ensure it lists all changes (hint: bzr log).

3. Generate the tarball:

    python setup.py sdist

4. Manually check the contents of the generated tarball (you'll find it
   in dist/) to ensure there's no file missing or too much, and try
   installing and running it.
   
   If you find a problem, fix it, commit the fix, and start again from 1.
   Hint: In case of a missing file or a useless file being there, edit
   the MANIFEST.in file.

5. Create a datached signature for the tarball, with:

    gpg --armor --sign --detach-sig \
        dist/gnome-activity-journal-$(python -c \
        'import src.config; print src.config.VERSION').tar.gz

6. Upload the tarball and the generated *.asc GPG signature to the right
   milestone on Launchpad.

7. Write an announcement e-mail and send it to the following mailing lists:

    + zeitgeist@lists.launchpad.net
    + gnome-zeitgeist-users@lists.launchpad.net
    + gnome-announce-list@gnome.org

10. Post an announcement on the Launchpad project page based on the e-mail.
